<b> Sept. 16. </b> Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for iid observations and not iid observations, Delta Method

<b> Sept. 23. </b> Histograms, density estimation using Kernel methods, KS-plots, QQ-plots, Empirical CDF, an example of Bootstrap (Temperature data was used this session)

<b> Oct. 7. </b> Hypothesis Testing (one sided and two sided), Wald Tests with and without Bootstrap, Likelihood Ratio Tests, Fisher Information, p-value, type-1 and type-2 errors, An example of all of these with Poisson data 

<b> Oct. 15. </b> Muti-variate Hypothesis Testing, Multiplicity in Hypothesis Testing, Bonferroni method, Benjamin-Hochberg method, type-1 error and type-2 error

<b> Oct. 21. </b> Linear models, Fisher Information Covariance matrix, Wald-Test and MLRT for linear models, t-student test, F-test 

<b> Oct. 28 </b> Extended linear models, factors and discrete random variables in linear models, Polynomial linear models, AIC, BIC, cross-validation methods, Forward and Backward stepwise linear regression

<b> Nov. 4 </b> Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Logistic regression, extended logistic regression, classifying with linear and quadratic boundaries

<b> Nov. 11 </b> The general outline for GLMs, Gamma GLM, Comparison between Gamma and Normal GLM (constant and non-constant variablity bands), Polynomial regression to approximate any continous functions 

<b> Nov. 18 </b> Time series, AR models, MA models, ARMA models, ARMAX models and their relation to linear regression. Using AIC/BIC, autocorrelation function (acf) and partial autocorrelation function (pacf) in choosing tuning parameters for ARMAX model.

<b> Nov. 25 </b> Fourier representation of time series, Finding Fourier coefficients, Spectral Analysis, Harmonic regression and its relation with linear regression, Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for harmonic regresison, Observing that just sine and cosine functions are not enough!
